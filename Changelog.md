# Changelog

## v0.1.6

- For array index access, this project uses `bigint` as the integer type, while TypeScript does not allow `bigint` as an index type by default. To address this, this release introduces two auto-fix approaches: ESLint and a TypeScript plugin. See ESLint diagnostics for details.
- The project template generated by `npm create genshin-ts@latest` has received notable updates.
- Fixed a regression from previous type-system changes that caused Chinese event hover docs/comments to stop showing correctly.

## v0.1.5

- Allowed common JS-style self-cleaning `setInterval` callbacks, for example:
    ```ts
    const h = setInterval(() => {
        f.printString('hello')
        if (condition) {
            clearInterval(h)
        }
    }, 1000)
    ```
- Allowed modifying outer `let` variables inside timer callbacks (including array mutations like `push`) so behavior matches normal JS expectations for common patterns. Code like below now compiles correctly:
    ```ts
    let acc = 5n
    const h = setInterval(() => {
        acc += 2n
        f.printString(str(acc))
        if (acc >= 9n) {
            clearInterval(h)
        }
    }, 1000)
    ```
- Fixed missing captures in nested callbacks inside timer callbacks. For example:
    ```ts
    setTimeout(() => {
        nums.forEach((v) => {
            f.printString(label)
            f.printString(str(v + base))
        })
    }, 200)
    ```
  Previously only `nums` was captured, while `label` and `base` were not captured correctly.
- Fixed a compile error where function symbols called inside timer callbacks were incorrectly treated as captured variables.
- `Array.forEach` callback parameters are no longer required and may be omitted.

## v0.1.4

- Fixed cases where eslint and timer-closure capture showed incorrect entity types after the entity type system became more complex in the previous release; the compiler now uses smarter entity type inference to avoid errors with complex type systems.
- In dev mode, external map saves now trigger auto re-injection, so accidental overwrites no longer require manual re-injection; this can be adjusted in config.
- Added support for extracting custom prefab names and ids from maps into code for easier lookup and interaction; the switch and output path are configurable.
- Added stricter validation for Beyond Mode and Classic Mode nodes to avoid accidentally using unavailable nodes via shortcuts; such cases now surface errors directly.
- Added an eslint warning for accessing outer event parameters inside timer callbacks, guiding users to fix it.

## v0.1.3

- The type system now automatically constrains node availability between Beyond Mode and Classic Mode
- Support placeholder methods like dict(0) and list(0) to allow empty argument pins in some nodes
- Added more detailed hover docs and usage notes for helper functions like raw/float/int/guid/list/dict
- Added a new Classic Mode node: `Revive Active Character`
- Fixed an error when creating the `Teleport Player` node in Classic Mode

## v0.1.2

- g.server() now accepts a mode field to switch between Beyond Mode and Classic Mode
- Added 14 new server nodes introduced in version 6.3, plus related entity helper properties and methods such as .activeCharacter and .classicModeId
- The type system does not yet distinguish node availability by mode; all nodes can be injected regardless of mode and must be used with care

## v0.1.1

- Initial release
